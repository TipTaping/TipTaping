- Iâ€™m @TipTaping, I'm definitly not smart, Im not even sure why I am making this.
  I live my life full of confusion and sporatic choices that leave me more confused.
  I am nothing more than a meat ball on earth and its up to others to deal with me.


- Do I enjoy coding?
  I would think I enjoy it, it is fun when I get something to work but, the only time I actally code is if its a late assignment.
  coding makes things make sense, its just numbers are either a 1's or a 0's all jumbled together that end up
  telling you that your taxes are overdue and are being band from a game for saying to many friendly words to players. So in-all I think code is fun.
  
- What code do I know?
  I know python and some scratch
  I want to learn others types of code like Java, or C++
  I am open to learn anyother type of code if the option arises.

  theres no reason to read this but if you have, good on you.
