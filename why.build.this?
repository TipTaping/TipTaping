You might be wondering, what platform did i use?
its a tough quesiton I understand.
I used Github to make my portfolio


I orginized everything by what would make sense.
that doesnt make sense but it does to me, just how my brain works.
The LEARNME.md section is there just as in introduction
The skill area wouldnt fit in but it would be grouped next to it, as I think thats to much for an introduction.
the projects where added sperate becuase I didnt want them to be one big group.
I hope that clears my the air of confusion.

what i learned from making this portfolio.
I leanred that I dont have that many skills and I should work on getting more of them
begin smart about certain subjects isnt what im good at
Im just good at putting what is needed together just so i can carry threw my day
I think making this helps with that, and shows that i need to improve more
I can saw i will do better in the future but knowing me i probably won't
I do things just becuase they have to be done, I think.
